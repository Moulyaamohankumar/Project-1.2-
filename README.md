1. What’s a Sign-Up Page?

The Sign-Up page is where users enter their details to create an account. This page typically includes fields like:

Name

Email

Password

This page allows users to provide their information, which will be sent to the server for processing. We’ll create a simple yet effective sign-up form that looks clean and is user-friendly.

2. What is Form Validation?

Form Validation ensures that the information users provide is correct and in the right format.

For instance:

Checking if the email is in the correct format.

Ensuring the password meets security criteria (e.g., minimum length).

Form validation helps prevent errors and ensures that the backend receives clean and valid data.

3. Implementation Details 🚀

React.js: To create a dynamic and responsive UI.

Tailwind CSS: For styling the components efficiently.

React Hook Form: To manage form state and validation.
