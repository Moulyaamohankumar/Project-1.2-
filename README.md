Description 

What is MERN 
MongoDB : It is used to store all over data of out project/App.

Express : Express provides easy-to-use methods and middleware to handle HTTP requests and responses. 
And also help in using in routing link GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.

React.js : React.js will be responsible for building the frontend, the part users interact with.Together, these technologies allow us to build a full-stack application where the frontend and backend communicate seamlessly.

Nodejs : This will be combined with the express and power the backend and helps in handling HTTPs request.

Project Overview.

In this project we will do an Ecommerce website. Where Frontend will be made with React.js. For backend we use Express and nodejs. For database we use MongoDb.

We make a Home page where we have product and search bar, filter option and cart option. And in the cart page we have products and total price of the products. In the Payment page we have the payment summary and paymnet things, 
and the user will have the invoice and tax bill. 1. What‚Äôs a Sign-Up Page?

The Sign-Up page is where users enter their details to create an account. This page typically includes fields like:

Name

Email

Password

This page allows users to provide their information, which will be sent to the server for processing. We‚Äôll create a simple yet effective sign-up form that looks clean and is user-friendly.

2. What is Form Validation?

Form Validation ensures that the information users provide is correct and in the right format.

For instance:

Checking if the email is in the correct format.

Ensuring the password meets security criteria (e.g., minimum length).

Form validation helps prevent errors and ensures that the backend receives clean and valid data.

3. Implementation Details üöÄ

Technologies Used:

React.js: To create a dynamic and responsive UI.

Tailwind CSS: For styling the components efficiently.

React Hook Form: To manage form state and validation.

Yup: For schema-based validation.

Features Implemented:

User-friendly sign-up form with Name, Email, and Password fields.

Form validation using Yup and React Hook Form:

Email validation ensures the input follows a proper email format.

Password validation requires a minimum length and security constraints.

Responsive design using Tailwind CSS to support different screen sizes.

Smooth user experience with clear error messages and input validation.

Code Structure:

Signup.js - Contains the sign-up form component.

styles.css - Additional custom styles (if needed).

validation.js - Defines validation schemas using Yup.

Steps for Milestone 5 üìù

In this milestone, you will work on the frontend while your mentor will guide you through:

Building the Sign-Up Page with React.js and Tailwind CSS.

Adding form validation using React Hook Form and Yup.

Ensuring the UI is fully responsive and user-friendly.

If you missed the mentor-led session, don‚Äôt worry! You can always go through the content and reach out to your mentor for help on any coding aspects.

Next Steps üöÄ

In the next milestone, we‚Äôll continue building out advanced features for your app, including:

Connecting the frontend with the backend.

Managing user sessions and authentication
Milestone 6: Backend for Signup Page

Learning Goals üéØ

By the end of this milestone, you will:

Understand how to encrypt passwords before saving them.

Know how to store complete user data securely in the database.

Why Encrypt Passwords?

Protect User Data: Keeps passwords safe if hackers access the database.

Privacy: Ensures user passwords aren‚Äôt visible to anyone.

Compliance: Follows security laws like GDPR and PCI-DSS.

Stops Password Theft: Encrypted passwords can‚Äôt be easily stolen or guessed.

Steps for Milestone 6 üìù

Encrypt the Password:

Use bcrypt to hash the user's password during signup.

Save the hashed password in the database instead of plain text.

Store Complete User Data:

Save all the user's data (e.g., name, email, etc.) in the database while ensuring that the password remains encrypted.

Accomplishments üéâ

Implemented backend functionality for user signup.

Used bcrypt to hash and securely store passwords.

Successfully saved user data in the database.

Ensured that passwords are never stored in plain text.

Successfully completed and submitted the assignment. ‚úÖ
